# ML Models

This repository is a collection of various machine learning models, personally developed and implemented. The project aims to provide a comprehensive set of examples for different machine learning techniques, ranging from basic algorithms to more advanced models, showcasing a wide array of applications and methodologies in the field of machine learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and experimentation.

### Prerequisites

To work with the ML models in this repository, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Relevant Python libraries as specified in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Begin by cloning the ML_models repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matusoff/ML_models.git
   cd ML_models

### Exploring the Models
Each model is contained within its own Jupyter Notebook. To explore a model, navigate to its corresponding notebook and open it using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb
```

### Models Included
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
Neural Networks

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to all the open-source projects and libraries that made this repository possible.
